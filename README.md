# MP3-Docs

MP3 is a friends-only private Discord server. Since I created a private Minecraft server network, configured modpacks, etc., I wanted set up this French website for our common use, mainly related to Minecraft.

You can't join us, but you can check out the source code of this [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) project if you find it useful.

### Fix the Samsung Internet dark mod

> Please note that this website is not responsive. I don't have the time for it, and it's not worth the effort since it's meant to be used while playing on a PC.

The Samsung Internet dark mod overrides the actual website dark mod and may produce some odd color changes.
An example can be found in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neocities/comments/1imaoup/is_there_anything_i_can_do_about_forced_dark_mode/).

According to [this Samsung Developer forum comment](https://forum.developer.samsung.com/t/websites-dark-mode-gets-overridden-by-samsung-internets-dark-mode/22937/34), there's no solution for developers yet, but users can either:
* Enable the **`internet://flags/#enable-adaptive-force-dark`** flag.
* Open Settings → Useful features → Labs → and enable "Use website dark theme".
